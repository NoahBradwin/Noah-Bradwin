# Noah Bradwin | Personal Portfolio

## Project Overview

This is a responsive, single-page personal portfolio application designed to showcase my work in **Management Engineering**, **Data Science**, and **Systems Optimization**. 

Unlike a standard template, this project was engineered from scratch to demonstrate mastery of **React component architecture** and modern **UI/UX principles**.

## Tech Stack

This project leverages a modern frontend toolchain optimized for performance and scalability:

### **Core Architecture**
* **[React 18](https://reactjs.org/):** Component-based UI library used for state management (Hooks) and modular DOM manipulation.
* **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/):** Frontend tooling that provides a fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimized build process.
* **[JavaScript (ES6+)]:** Primary logic layer handling dynamic routing, event listeners, and data mapping.


### **Deployment**
* **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/):** The development environment is fully containerized to ensure consistent behavior across different machines and operating systems.
